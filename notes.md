- modern monorepo approach (using npm workspaces)
- correct usage of namespace, project name and uimodule name 
- no workarounds
- following best practices of yeoman
- no `try {} catch {}` quick fixes
- clearer variable names
- instantly deployable
- better file structure, e.g. usage of `prompts.js` for every subgenerator

## Easy UI5 project generator 2.0 - a new implementation and best practices

In this talk we will dive into the newest implementation of the Easy UI5 project generator (generator-ui5-project) and its benefits. We will also talk about new best practices for project architectures with multiple UI(5) modules and how you can follow them using the new generator-ui5-project.

## Breaking changes

### model

- We renamed the `newmodel` subgenerator to `model`. After all, we also call it `project` generator (and not `newproject` generator) ðŸ™‚
- remove `bindingMode` option
- remove `countMode` option
- We now (optionally) automatically set up a proxy for new models using the `fiori-tools-proxy`.

### fpmpage

- `enablefpm` subgenerator now part of the more extensive `fpmpage` subgenerator, as it couldn't really be called standalone anyway
